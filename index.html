<p>Working on Streaming DataPipeline hosted at Azure utilizing Kubernetes to help acquire, transform and mine real time
signals from Dell devices, storage and network components at a massive scale to enable Data Scientists run better
models faster and more importantly more pre emptively for a better support infrastructure</p>

<ul>
<li>&ndash; Scala with zio-streams, http4s, cats.</li>
<li>Data Visualization &ndash; Prometheus + Grafana</li>
<li>Azure</li>
</ul>

<p>Respponsible for designing, architecting and implementing this offering on scala 2.12 and a mix of typelevel libs in
cats, circe, http4s and zio for stream and stream combinators.  Build and Deployments is using GitLab and k8s+Terraform
to provision.  Also researching Graph DB and GraphQL approach for an Enterprise Knowledge Graph solution for the fraud
detection and support assist teams.</p>

<p>Worked on Machine Learning REST Service hosted at AWS utilizing EC2 to enable an application for Citrine to serve its ML
Library built on Scala.  The REST service interacted with a Data Service Component (Dynamo DB + Postgres) and integrated
with a TypeScript REST API that provided authentication and authoriziation leveraging JWT.</p>

<ul>
<li>&ndash; Scala with Akka(Actors, Http, Streams), cats, json4s, cats-effect</li>
<li>AWS (SQS, Cloudwatch, EC2, DynamoDB, S3, Lambda, AWS Batch)</li>
<li>Data Visualization &ndash; Monitoring Service + statsD + DataDog + AWS Lambda to move data from Cloudwatch to Datadog</li>
</ul>

<p>Responsible for implementing and refactoring this service built on scala 2.12 to migrate to a pure FP approach using cats +
cats-effects and bringing better testing approach using scalacheck.  Build and Deployments was using Pants + Jenkins +
CF/Jssonet templates</p>

<h3 id="spiceworks-inc-staff-data-engineer">Spiceworks Inc — Staff Data Engineer</h3>

<p>Worked on Streaming Data Pipeline to support a RTB (Real Time Bidding) for the adtech space.  The Pipeline had 23
microservices that were deployed on AWS on EKS with Monitoring support using DataDog.  The Persistence stores ranged
from RDS(Schema ereg), to Redis(cache and lookup), to Cassandra(Graph + History), to DynamoDB and AthenaDB(datalake),
and finally to Kafka as data backplane.
Orchestration and ETL was built using Airflow (Python 3.6)
The RTB stack was built on GoLang</p>

<ul>
<li>&ndash; Scala with Akka(Actors, Http, Streams, Persistence), fs2, cats, cats-effect, circe, doobie, shapeless, sangria, Gatling</li>
<li>AWS (Kinesis, Eks, Athena, Lambda, Glue)</li>
<li>Heavy use of Kafka</li>
<li>Data Visualiztion migrated from Eks to NewRelic to DataDog</li>
</ul>

<p>Responsible for implementing and refactoring this service built on scala 2.12 and later to migrate to a pure FP approach using cats +
fs2 and http4s and bringing better testing approach using scalacheck.  Build and Deployments was using sbt + Gitlab +
k8s + Terraform.</p>

<ul>
<li>&ndash; Scala with spark, spark-job-server, Gatling</li>
<li>AWS (EMR + CF)</li>
<li>Heavy use of Kafka</li>
<li>Data Visualiztion using ELK stack</li>
</ul>

<p>Responsible for designing, implementing this application built on scala 2.11 and spark.  Build and Deployments were using
an Atlassian Stack in Bamboo and then Gradle to build the artifacts.  Additionally at this company I also worked on
projects that included Search Infra (Elastic Search) and a Readmission application using Node.js/Java/Guice, Spring.</p>

<p>Previous to this I worked at Escalation Point (Java Developer), Zilliant (Solution Architect in Price Optimiation),
